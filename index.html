            Ivy received a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing 
            from the University of Nebraska at Omaha.  After completing her degree, she was hired by a 
            health insurance company called Aetna. There she began in the Finance Department, where she
            learned how to use vlookups and pivot tables.  Soon after, Ivy transferred to the Marketing
            Department where she maintained Microsoft Access databases and became familiar with querying 
            information from a data warehouse.  It was at this point that Ivy decided she wanted a career in 
            Information Technology.  Ivy is currently a Business Analyst in higher education, where she works 
            with a student information system and related systems.  Her interest has continued to grow.  She is 
            now pursuing her Masters in Management Information Systems.
